# A watcher of clouds

is a curious being. She imagines connections and representations of patterns from a distant, limited perspective. Curiosity alone solves few of her problems. Although observation, rigorously practiced, has taught her to predict storms and importantly, rainbows as well. 

#### engineer  |   cloud & culture

An engineer designs, builds and maintains systems, whether systems of machines or of human relations. A system is complex in its number of components and the mechanics between them.  


### gathering knowledge 
_The path to learning began as the youngest granddaughter of a superintendent of schools in a family of scholars. The expectation was clear:   
learn what is valued._

Deana Solis is the daughter of Filipino immigrants and the mom of a biracial son.

She is an award winning ambassador of a professional association dedicated to advancing and supporting the practitioner community in cloud FinOps. She mentors and volunteers in spaces that seek to acknowledge privilege, confront bias and demand safety for groups that have been historically marginalized and excluded from access to opportunity.

Occasionally she revives stories from the jobs that don't appear on her Linked In profile as a means to reclaim the experiences hidden behind formal degrees and certifications. Recruiters told her those jobs did not add value. They did not know her value, so she didn't listen.
