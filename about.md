# engineer  |   cloud & culture

More than a title, I am an engineer who designs, builds and maintains systems, whether systems of machines or of human relations.

### gathering knowledge 
_The path to learning began as the youngest granddaughter of a superintendent of schools in a family of scholars. The expectation was clear:   
learn what is valued._

### previous life

_Before my titles in healthcare digital transformation, and even longer before becoming a cloud practitioner, every role was an opportunity to apply knowledge, solve problems, and serve community._

>###working student from the age of 16
>>clerk, fabric cutter, cashier, telemarketer  
>>direct marketer,  fundraiser, sales counselor

>In my junior year in the School of Liberal Arts at Cal Poly, Pomona, my part-time sales income exceeded the prospective offers garnered by many of my graduating peers. Accepting an offer to enter a management training program seemed the obvious career decision. I took the opportunity, relocated to the Pacific Northwest, and grand-open eight stores for two electronics retailers. I wouldn't trade that six years of grind and hustle, and acute focus on service excellence.

>The old millennium was running out. My 5600k baud modem gave me blazing fast dial-up internet. Change was coming and I was ready for it. I enrolled for two semesters to finish my undergraduate work

Deana Solis is the daughter of Filipino immigrants and the mom of a biracial son.

She is an award winning ambassador of a professional association dedicated to advancing and supporting the practitioner community in cloud FinOps. She mentors and volunteers in spaces that seek to acknowledge privilege, confront bias and demand safety for groups that have been historically marginalized and excluded from access to opportunity.

Occasionally she revives stories from the jobs that don't appear on her Linked In profile as a means to reclaim the experiences hidden behind formal degrees and certifications. Recruiters told her those jobs did not add value. They did not know her value, so she didn't listen.
