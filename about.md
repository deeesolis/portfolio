# engineer  |   cloud & culture

More than a title, I am an engineer who designs, builds and stewards systems, whether systems of machines or of human relations.

### gathering knowledge 
_The path to learning began as the youngest granddaughter of a superintendent of schools in a family of scholars. The expectation was clear:   
learn what is valued; **learn like a machine**._

### becoming by doing

_Before becoming a cloud practitioner, every role was an opportunity to apply knowledge, solve problems, and connect people and technology. If I could learn every day, I would outgrow most roles, and the next one would keep finding me._

_From 2001 through 2014, I navigated through technical roles in healthcare. My first promotion, aside from merit and seniority, was from service and support to professional services in 2005. It is no accident. My professional growth was catalyzed in the period when my hospital employer was adopting a digital transformation and had outsourced its technology and application service departments._

_In 1991, my junior year in the School of Liberal Arts at Cal Poly, Pomona, my part-time sales income exceeded the prospective offers garnered by many of my graduating peers. Accepting an offer to enter a management training program seemed the obvious career decision. I took the opportunity, relocated to the Pacific Northwest, and grand-open eight stores for two electronics retailers. I wouldn't trade that seven years of grind, hustle, and acute focus on service excellence. Until it burned me out._  


_The old millennium was running out. My 5600k baud modem gave me blazing fast dial-up internet. Change was coming and I was ready for it. I enrolled for two semesters to finish my undergraduate work. I temporarily relocated to eastern Washington state where I found a part-time job answering phones at the computer lab service desk between classes. Life is a circle._


### unlearning

Deana Solis is the daughter of Filipino immigrants and the mom of a biracial son.

Before she was an award winning FinOps [ambassador](https://www.finops.org/about/ambassadors-info/), she had to unlearn a few things she had internalized about success, fortune, and power. 

She mentors and volunteers in spaces that seek to acknowledge privilege, confront bias and demand safety for people who have been historically marginalized and excluded from access to opportunity.

Occasionally she revives stories from the jobs that don't appear on her Linked In profile as a means to reclaim the experiences hidden behind formal degrees and certifications. Recruiters told her those jobs did not add value. They did not know her value, so she didn't listen.
